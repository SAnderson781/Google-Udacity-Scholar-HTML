## Project Instructions

**Review the Article to Mockup Project Rubric.**

1. Download and unzip mockup-to-article.zip in the Supporting Materials section, below. You'll find index.html, the article mockup image (blog-mockup.pdf) and a file called reflections.txt inside.
2. Use what you've learned about web development so far to edit index.html so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements, which means that you'll need to research and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough."). Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single <br> tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. The text should naturally wrap depending on how wide the window is.

**PROJECT SPECIFICATION**

- All text is formatted identically to the mockup. You should not use break tags for this project. You can create the desired separation with paragraph tags.
- The imageâ€™s source is the correct URL and all links in the article are correct.
